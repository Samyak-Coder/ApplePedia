        The next generation iBook G3 lost the previous bold colours and bulky form-factor, as were the handle, latch-less design, and additional power connectors on the bottom surface. 

        The resulting iBook was available in white only, hence the name “snow” and incorporated transparent polycarbonate in its casing. It was 30% lighter, and occupied less than half of the volume of the model it replaced, being smaller in all 3 dimensions. Despite that, it added an extra USB port and a higher resolution screen. Apple claimed the compact design did not sacrifice durability, saying “twice as durable” as the previous model. 
        
        With the revision, apple began tranitioning to translucent and white polycarbonate casing in most of its consumer line, such as the iMac and the eMac. In contrast, most of its professional products used an anodised aluminium finish. Near the end of its run, the snow becam opaque and white instead translucent white and magnesium.

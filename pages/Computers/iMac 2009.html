        <p>In March 2009, Apple released a minor refresh of the iMac line. Changes included a fourth USB port, replacement of two FireWire 400 ports with one FireWire 800 port, replacement of mini-DVI with Mini DisplayPort, and a slightly redesigned base which is thinner. The exterior design was almost identical to the older Intel-based iMacs. The models were one 20-inch configuration and three 24-inch configurations (instead of two at each screen size as before).</p> 
        <p>Apple doubled the default RAM and hard-disk size on all models, moving the RAM to the DDR3 specification. This revision also introduced a new, smaller, and more compact Apple Keyboard that excluded the numeric keypad and forward delete key in favor of the fn + Delete keyboard shortcut by default.[17] Users could, however, replace this version with a more traditional, full-size model with a numeric keypad by requesting Apple to build their machine to order through its online store.</p>

            <H2>3rd generation iMac: Unibody iMac</H2>
                <p>In October 2009, a 16:9 aspect ratio screen was introduced in 21.5" and 27" models, replacing the 20" and 24" 16:10 aspect ratio screens of the previous generation. The back is now a continuation of the aluminum body from the front and sides instead of a separate plastic backplate. Video card options entirely switched to AMD, save for the standard onboard Nvidia card in the base smaller model. The iMac's processor selection saw a significant increase.</p>
                <p>The Intel i-series chips are introduced to Mac for the first time on the higher-spec 27-inch models.</p>
                <p>Default RAM has also been increased across the iMac range. With the advent of the larger screens, Apple doubled the number of memory slots from two to four. Consequently, the maximum memory capacity was also doubled (to 16 GB),[25] and for Intel Core i-series (27-inch), quadrupled, to 32 GB.</p>
                <p>The 27-inch models of the line became the first to offer Target Display Mode, allowing the iMac to be used as an external display for another Mac computer when connected via Mini DisplayPort, a feature that was extended to the 21.5-inch models onwards with the introduction of Thunderbolt.</p>
                <p>The Mid-2010 iMac 27" has AMD Radeon HD5650 and HD5750 graphic cards. Both cards cannot support Metal without graphic acceleration, preventing this model from upgrading to Mojave and Catalina. AMD had developed the firmware upgrade that would allowed both graphic cards to support Metal and Mid-2010 iMac to be upgraded to latest macOS, but Apple had refused to certify them.</p>
                The Late 2011 Unibody iMac is also the last model to include an internal SuperDrive.

        <p>The Intel-based iMac is a series of Macintosh desktop computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. since 2006. It is a member of the iMac family. It is one of four desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, serving as an all-in-one alternative to the Mac Mini, and sits below the performance range iMac Pro and Mac Pro.</p>
        <p>Pre-2009 iMac models featured either a white polycarbonate enclosure or an aluminum enclosure. The October 2009 iMac model featured a unibody aluminum enclosure, a version of which can still be seen on the current model. The current iMacs released since October 2012 also feature a much thinner display, with the edge measuring just 5 mm. </p>

            <H2>History</H2>
  <p>At the Macworld Conference and Expo on January 10, 2006, Steve Jobs announced that the new iMac would be the first Macintosh to use an Intel CPU, the Core 2 Duo. The introduction of the new iMac along with the Intel-based MacBook Pro was the start of the Mac transition to Intel processors. In the following months, the other Mac products followed, including the introduction of the Intel Core-powered Mac mini on February 28, 2006, the MacBook consumer line of laptop computers on May 16, 2006, the Mac Pro on August 7, 2006, and the Xserve in November 2006, completing the transition.</p>
<p>The features, price, and case design remained unchanged from the iMac G5. The processor speed, however, according to tests run by Apple using SPEC, was declared to be two to three times faster than the iMac G5.</p>
<p>On June 22, 2020, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference keynote included the announcement that future Macintosh computers would transition yet again to Apple's own ARM-based processor technology, eliminating the company's use of Intel x86-64 compatible CPUs. The transition was said to take place over a two-year period, with the first "Apple Silicon" Macs shipping to consumers by the end of 2020.</p>
<H2>1st generation: Polycarbonate iMac</H2>
<p>Alongside the MacBook Pro, the iMac Core Duo represents Apple's first computer to feature Intel processors instead of PowerPC processors. It retained the style, design, and features of the iMac G5.</p>
<p>In early February 2006, Apple confirmed reports of video display problems on the new Intel-based iMacs. When playing video on Apple's Front Row media browser, some 20-inch iMacs (those built-to-order with upgraded video cards) showed random horizontal lines, ghosting, video tearing and other problems. The problem was fixed with a software update.</p>
<p>In late 2006, Apple introduced a new version of the iMac including a Core 2 Duo chip and a lower price. Apple added a new 24-inch model with IPS-display and a resolution of 1920 Ã— 1200 (WUXGA), making it the first iMac to be able to display 1080p content in its full resolution, and a VESA Flat Display Mounting Interface. Except for the 17-inch 1.83 GHz processor model, this version also included an 802.11n draft card.</p>
